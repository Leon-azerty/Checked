## Checked

Checked is a todo app with a tag system feature. It allows user to oragnize, filter and sort his todos easily. In one click you can show only the todos with a specific tag or a combination tags.

## Stack 

Checked was developped using NextJs as front-end framework, Tailwind for the css, Typescript for avoid errors and Supabase for the backend/database.  

## Why ?

I have choosen to develop Checked because I'm a huge fan of Notion's application like.
Then a todo app is typically a good idea to learn a techno as it was my situation.
